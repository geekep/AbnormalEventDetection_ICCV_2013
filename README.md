Abnormality Detection in MATLAB
=====
This is the Matlab code based on the public code written by Cewu Lu and on the following paper,
> [1] "[Abnormal Event Detection at 150 FPS in Matlab](http://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cwlu/Anormality_1000_FPS/abnormal_final3.pdf)" , Cewu Lu, Jianping Shi, Jiaya Jia, in ICCV, 2013

### Sparse Combination
The sparse combination training system is written by Ruya Gong based on [1] due to the absence of the code of this part.
### Dataset
The training and testing videos are downloaded from the paper author's page:
