Abnormality Detection in MATLAB
=====
This is the Matlab code based on the public code written by Cewu Lu and on the following paper,
> [1] "[Abnormal Event Detection at 150 FPS in Matlab](http://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cwlu/Anormality_1000_FPS/abnormal_final3.pdf)" , Cewu Lu, Jianping Shi, Jiaya Jia, in ICCV, 2013

###Sparse Combination
The sparse combination training system is written by Ruya Gong based on [1] due to the absence of the code of this part.
###Dataset
The training and testing videos are downloaded from the paper author's page:
[http://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cwlu/Anormality\_1000\_FPS/dataset.html](http://appsrv.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~cwlu/Anormality_1000_FPS/dataset.html)
, and from the following project website:
